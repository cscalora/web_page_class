		<hr/>
		
		<p>I am the oldest child in my family, as my little sister is 5 years younger than
		me. We are Disney nerds and go a few times a year! I have been to <b>Walt Disney 
		World</b> at least 40 times! It's my favorite vacation spot!</p>
		
		<p>In college I would like to major in Architecture or Architectural 
		Engineering, and I've been interested in that for a few years. My dream job is to 
		be a Disney Imagineer. My family is huge Penn State Football fans, so I have my 
		heart set on going there.</p>
		
		<p>I run cross country for Padua and I am on the golf team! When I'm not doing 
		homework, at the driving range, or at practice, I like to watch America's Got 
		Talent with my sister!! My favorite color is powder blue!</p>
