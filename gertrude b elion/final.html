    	    <p><!--first paragraph-->
    	    	Gertrude Belle Elion was born in 1918 in New York, New York. She was a
    	    	stand out student in highschool, but first found her passion for medicine
    	    	when her grandfather died from cancer. She went off to college at 
    	    	<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/main/">Hunter College</a> and majored
    	    	in chemistry. At the time, it was difficult for women
    	    	to have a career in chemistry, which was typically a man’s job. In the 
    	    	meantime, she went back to school, attending 
    	    	<a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a> where she
    	    	earned her master’s degree. After she graduated, she was unable to find a 
    	    	job until World War II. Because the men were fighting in the war, chemist 
    	    	jobs opened up, and she began to work in a laboratory.
    	    </p>
    	    <p><!--second paragraph-->
    	    	Using a new form of biochemistry with her long-time partner and friend, 
    	    	George Hitchings, Gertrude and George made many groundbreaking drugs. One 
    	    	drug that they made, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercaptopurine">Prinethol</a>, 
    	    	was the first treatment for leukemia. 
    	    	Another drug they made was the first drug to treat AIDS. They made other 
    	    	drugs that treated herpes, malaria, gout, and another helped with organ 
    	    	skin transplants.
    	    </p>
    	    <p><!--third paragraph-->
    	    	Gertrude B. Elion was a woman of great knowledge, dedication, and 
    	    	perseverance. Being a woman chemist in the mid 20th century did not stop 
    	    	her from expanding her knowledge or changing the medicinal world. Gertrude 
    	    	B. Elion truly changed medicine throughout her life.
