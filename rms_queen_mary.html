		<p>Visit our ship, The RMS Queen Mary, in Long Beach, California!! Our ship has 
		been voted one of the Top 10 Most Haunted Places in America by Time magazine!
		Among the many, many ghosts who still haunt this ship are sailors who died in 
		the engine room, a "lady in white", and children who have drowned in the ship's
		pool. This spot is sure to spook you! Contact us today to book a tour, dine with us, 
		or stay aboard this haunted ship! </p>

	<p><b>Good for the whole family</b></p>
		<blockquote>The RMS Queen Mary tours were great fun for our 8 year old daughter 
		and 15 year old son. Definitely will not give them bad dreams, but spooked all of
		us! I highly recommend coming here for vacation, as the location is perfect!
